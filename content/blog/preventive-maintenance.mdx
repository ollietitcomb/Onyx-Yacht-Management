## The Temptation to Defer

It's tempting to skip non-urgent maintenance. The engine starts fine. The generator runs. Why spend money on servicing when everything works?

This logic is the single most expensive mistake yacht owners make.

## The True Cost of Deferred Maintenance

Deferred maintenance doesn't save money—it just moves costs into the future, usually with a multiplier attached.

### Example: Engine Service

- **Preventive**: Annual service at £2,500
- **Deferred**: Engine failure requiring rebuild at £35,000 + lost charter income

That "saved" service cost you £32,500—plus the disruption and reputational damage of a mid-charter breakdown.

## The Multiplier Effect

When maintenance is deferred, problems compound:

1. **Minor wear becomes major failure**: A £200 impeller becomes a £15,000 heat exchanger
2. **One system affects others**: A clogged filter strains a pump, which damages a motor
3. **Downtime costs**: Lost charter income, missed seasons, emergency yard fees

## What Preventive Maintenance Includes

A proper preventive maintenance program covers:

### Engines and Generators

- Oil and filter changes
- Cooling system inspection
- Belt and hose replacement
- Fuel system servicing
- Load testing

### Systems

- Air conditioning filters and refrigerant
- Watermakers (membranes and pumps)
- Bilge pumps and high-water alarms
- Electrical systems and batteries
- Plumbing and through-hulls

### Safety Equipment

- Life raft servicing (annual)
- Fire extinguisher inspection
- Flare replacement (in-date)
- EPIRB battery replacement

### Hull and Structure

- Antifouling (annual or biannual)
- Anodes replacement
- Through-hull inspection
- Deck hardware and rigging (sailing yachts)

## The Onyx Approach

We create bespoke maintenance schedules for every vessel, based on:

- Manufacturer recommendations
- Usage patterns (hours, miles, conditions)
- Equipment age and history
- Operational requirements (charter vs private)

### Our Process

1. **Audit**: Full technical audit of current state
2. **Schedule**: Build preventive maintenance calendar
3. **Execute**: Coordinate all work with trusted suppliers
4. **Track**: Monitor and report on all work performed
5. **Optimize**: Refine schedule based on performance

## ROI of Preventive Maintenance

Clients on our preventive maintenance programs see:

- **60% reduction** in emergency call-outs
- **40% lower** annual maintenance costs vs reactive approach
- **Near-zero** mid-season breakdowns
- **Higher resale value** due to documented service history

## Case Study: 68ft Motor Yacht

A client came to us after three years of minimal maintenance. The immediate costs to stabilize the vessel:

- Engine rebuilds: £42,000
- Generator replacement: £18,000
- Air conditioning overhaul: £12,000
- Safety equipment: £6,000

**Total**: £78,000

If preventive maintenance had been followed (at £8,000/year), they would have spent £24,000 over three years and avoided the failures entirely.

**Savings**: £54,000

## How to Start

1. **Commission a technical audit**: Understand current state
2. **Build a schedule**: Work with your management team to create a plan
3. **Budget properly**: Allocate 5-10% of vessel value annually
4. **Stick to it**: Consistency is key

## Conclusion

Preventive maintenance isn't an expense—it's an investment in reliability, safety, and resale value.

The question isn't whether you can afford preventive maintenance. It's whether you can afford not to.
