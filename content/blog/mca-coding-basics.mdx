## Introduction

If you own a yacht in UK waters and want to charter it commercially, you'll need to comply with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) regulations. This process, commonly called "MCA coding," ensures vessels meet safety and operational standards.

Here's what you need to know.

## What is MCA Coding?

MCA coding refers to the certification process required for commercial operation of yachts under 24 meters in UK waters. The specific code you need depends on your vessel's size and operating area.

### Common Codes

- **Category 0**: Unlimited worldwide
- **Category 1**: Up to 150 miles from safe haven
- **Category 2**: Up to 60 miles from safe haven (most common for charter)
- **Category 3**: Up to 20 miles from safe haven
- **Category 4**: Up to 20 miles from safe haven in favorable weather

Most charter yachts in the UK and Med operate under **Category 2** coding.

## Requirements for MCA Coding

To achieve MCA coding, your vessel must meet standards in several areas:

### 1. Safety Equipment

- Life rafts (serviced annually)
- SOLAS emergency pack
- Flares and pyrotechnics (in-date)
- Fire extinguishers and fire blankets
- First aid kits
- EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon)

### 2. Navigation Equipment

- GPS and chart plotter
- Compass (adjusted and certified)
- Radar (if required for category)
- VHF radio with DSC capability
- AIS (Automatic Identification System)

### 3. Structural and Systems

- Watertight integrity
- Bilge pumps and high-water alarms
- Electrical systems to standard
- Gas systems certified
- Stability information on board

### 4. Crew Qualifications

- Skipper with commercial endorsement
- Crew with relevant certificates (STCW, medical, etc.)
- Adequate crew-to-guest ratio

## The Certification Process

### Step 1: Initial Survey

A certifying surveyor inspects your vessel against MCA standards. This typically takes 4-6 hours and covers all safety systems, structure, and equipment.

### Step 2: Rectification

If deficiencies are found, you'll need to address them before certification. Common issues include expired flares, outdated charts, or non-compliant fire equipment.

### Step 3: Issue of Certificate

Once compliant, the surveyor issues your Small Commercial Vessel (SCV) certificate, valid for 5 years. Annual inspections are required to maintain certification.

## Costs

Budget for:

- **Initial Survey**: £800-£1,500
- **Equipment Upgrades**: £2,000-£8,000 (if not already compliant)
- **Annual Surveys**: £500-£800
- **Safety Equipment Annual Service**: £1,000-£2,000

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Leaving It Too Late

MCA coding can take 4-8 weeks if equipment needs to be ordered. Start early.

### 2. Underestimating Costs

Safety equipment is expensive. Get a pre-survey assessment to understand your shortfall.

### 3. Crew Qualifications

Ensure your skipper has the right commercial endorsements—personal qualifications aren't enough.

### 4. Insurance

Standard pleasure craft insurance doesn't cover commercial charter. You'll need specialized cover.
