## The Challenge

A client approached us in March with a familiar problem: they'd purchased a Sunseeker Predator 57 over winter, planning to use it extensively from May onwards. The vessel had been poorly maintained by the previous owner.

After a pre-purchase survey revealed £18,000 of deferred work, the seller agreed to a price reduction—but left it to the new owner to sort out. With just eight weeks until planned family cruising, the clock was ticking.

## Our Approach

We immediately conducted a detailed technical audit at the vessel's berth in Ocean Village. The survey highlighted issues typical of poor owner-operator maintenance:

### Critical Issues Identified

- **Propulsion**: Starboard engine overheating, heat exchanger corrosion
- **Antifouling**: Not done in 18 months, significant barnacle growth
- **Safety Equipment**: Flares expired, life raft service overdue
- **Electrics**: Shore power tripping, battery bank at 40% capacity
- **Maintenance Records**: None. No service history at all.

### The Eight-Week Plan

1. **Week 1**: Detailed specification, yard booking, parts ordering
2. **Weeks 2-3**: Lift-out, hull work, antifouling, anodes
3. **Weeks 3-4**: Engine service, heat exchanger replacement
4. **Weeks 5-6**: Electrical work, battery replacement, shore power fix
5. **Week 7**: Safety equipment service, sea trial
6. **Week 8**: Final checks, handover, owner familiarisation

## Execution

We coordinated all work through a single Hamble yard we trust, avoiding the owner having to deal with multiple contractors:

- **Yard liaison**: Weekly updates, photo documentation
- **Parts sourcing**: Genuine Sunseeker parts at trade rates
- **Scheduling**: Work sequenced to minimise yard time (and cost)
- **Insurance**: Coordinated with underwriter for lift-out coverage

The owner visited once during the project. Everything else was handled remotely.

## Results

The vessel was delivered back to Ocean Village on time, fully serviced, and ready for the season.

### Outcomes

- ✅ All work completed on budget (£16,200 vs £18,000 estimated)
- ✅ Propulsion system overhauled with 12-month warranty
- ✅ Full service history created from scratch
- ✅ Owner's family enjoyed 22 trouble-free days afloat that summer
- ✅ Now on a preventive maintenance plan (no more surprises)

## Client Feedback

> "I had no idea how to manage a project like this. Onyx handled everything—I just approved the quotes. The boat's been brilliant all season, and I finally understand what I own."

This project showcased our ability to stabilize a neglected vessel, coordinate efficient yard work, and set up new owners for long-term success.
